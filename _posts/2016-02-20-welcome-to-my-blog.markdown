My name is `Stanisław Szcześniak`.
You can also know me as `s17k` (GitHub), `stanislas` (IRC), `stasszczesniak` (Facebook, Google) or `stanszczesniak` (Twitter)


I am mostly interested in algorithms, machine/deep learning and cryptography.
Currently, I am trying to make [BookBrainz](https://bookbrainz.org) great.
